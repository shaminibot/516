/*Task
Create a web page with an embedded JavaScript program that plays the “number guessing game” with the user as follows:

The user is asked to think of an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
The program needs to repeatedly take guesses at the number the user has in mind.
To each of the program’s guesses, the user responds “<” if the target number is less than the program’s guess; “>” if the target number is greater than the program’s guess; or “yes” if the program has guessed the number correctly.
You need to come up with and implement the most efficient strategy for your program.

Sample game
Your program (prompt box): Is your number 23?
User (enters into the prompt box): <
Your program: Is your number 1?
User: >
Your program (prompt box): Is your number 14?
User (enters into the prompt box): yes
Your program (alert box): I won!*/
alert("Think of an integer between 1 and 100")
maxNo=100
minNo = 50
number = maxNo/2;
do {
	sign = prompt(" If your number is " + number ", type yes" + "If less than" + number "type < or If greater than" + number "type >")
	if  (sign == "<"){
	   maxNo = minNo
	   number=maxNo/2;}
	else (Sign == ">"){
	    
		number=maxNo/2;}
	}   
while (sign!="yes")
alert("I won!);
