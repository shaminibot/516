                   A Treasure of Wisdom Words

   The project idea is to create a vocabulary-based application that will be useful for
learners interested in enriching their experience in learning new words and elevating 
their language learning experience. The motivation for the project stems from the idea 
that when some language learners come across new or interesting words while they are 
reading some texts, they may want to note those words to use them later in spoken or 
written forms. When they gather these words or phrases in a traditional notebook,
it may  not always be easy to glean them when needed, due to the organizational format. 
Nevertheless, when these words are stored in an electronic form by scanning the text and
then storing the words in an alphabetized order, they can be easily accessed later using a 
simple search function. Additionally, using traditional means, when readers take time to
note down an interesting word or a phrase, they may get distracted and potentially lose
their enthusiasm in what they were currently reading. The affordance of this application
will mitigate the aforementioned challenge by allowing the user to tag the word/phrase 
in the text. Later, when the user/learner is ready to research the word, they will be
connected to an online dictionary which will allow them to research the word in context
for its semantic and lexical information, and they can then store it by copying and
pasting it in their personal electronic vocabulary lexicon, thus creating a list of 
words, they could treasure forever.
